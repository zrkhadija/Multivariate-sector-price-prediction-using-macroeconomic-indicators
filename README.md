# 📈 Multivariate Sector Price Prediction Using Macroeconomic Indicators
This project leverages deep learning to predict the prices of 10 financial sectors simultaneously. By combining historical sector data and macroeconomic indicators, a custom-built LSTM model in PyTorch was developed from scratch to handle multivariate time series data.
# Project Highlights
- ** Advanced Preprocessing Technique**: insuring stationnarity without losing memory of information from original data.
- **Multivariate Predictions**: Predict the prices of 10 financial sectors simultaneously.
- **Custom LSTM Model**: Built from scratch using PyTorch to handle complex time series relationships.
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**: Integrated key economic data with sectoral historical prices for improved forecasting.
- **End-to-End Workflow**: Includes data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
  # 📊 Dataset Description
  The inputs for this project include:
- **Sector Historical Data**: Price data for 10 financial sectors over time.
- **Macroeconomic Indicators**: Features such as GDP, inflation rates, unemployment rates, and other relevant indicators.
  The combined dataset captures both sectoral trends and macroeconomic influences, essential for accurate multivariate predictions.
